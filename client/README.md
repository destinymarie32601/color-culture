# Color Culture

## Description
This is a work in progress React application, for artists and art enthusiasts, to have their own platform to connect, browse, buy and sell art work. This application uses React JS, React-Bootstrap, Lottie-React, Bootstrap, Swiper, and MongoDB. This application was created by Alfredo Jimenez, Blake Edwards, David Rodriguez,and Destiny Dardon. This concept of this application was to create a unique and individual app for every day artists, and every day art consumers. This application will definitely improve with future development, adding more functionality, and creating a social media esque for artists/users everywhere. 

## Usage 
The user can swipe through different art pieces on the home page. They can browse through a gallery-like page and pick their favorite art pieces. The user can browse through different profiles on the artists page, and with future development, they will see a social media set up with a 3d Swiper, of artists photos and their profile link. With future development, the user will be able to search for their favorite artists by first and last name on the search page, access their profile and see different commission packages the artist offers, along with a mini portfolio example of their work. With future development, the user will be able to log in, and access their own personal profile, and will be able to sell their art as well.  With future development, the user will be able to add items to their cart as well as contact, comment and like different art pieces/art profiles. Our group intends to finish this application to ensure a smooth and functional application.
